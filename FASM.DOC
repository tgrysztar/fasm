1  Introduction

1.1  What is fasm?

     The fasm assembler is a fast, efficient 80x86 assembler that runs
in 'flat real mode'.  So, it must be run on at least an 80386 PC, but
it can certainly assemble programs for any 80x86 PC.  Unlike many other
80x86 assemblers, fasm only requires the source code to include the in-
formation it really needs.  See the 'asm' files in the 'examples' sub-
directory to see how simple it can be!	The files in the 'source' and
'examples' subdirectories are good references for more complex examples.

1.2  Hardware requirements

     Aside from the above-mentioned need for at least an 80386 CPU, the
hardware needs are small; at least one megabyte of extended memory is
reccommended for best performance.

1.3  Software and OS requirements

     Other than an OS compatible with MSDOS 2.0+, fasm needs no other
software.  Note that fasm will not run if the CPU is in protected or
V86 modes, since flat real mode cannot be entered in that case.

1.4  Output formats

     There are two possible output formats; by default, the output of
fasm is a non-relocatable binary image such as a 'com' or 'sys' program.
Use of the directive 'format MZ' produces a relocatable and possibly
multi-segment 'exe' program.  No extra 'linking' step is needed!

1.5  Output file ordering

     All output code is in the order in which it was entered into the
source file.  So, program code or at least an instruction such as 'jmp
start' must be at the beginning of the source code unless the program
is in multi-segment MZ format.	In that case, see the 'entry' directive
(below).

2  Using flat assembler

2.1  Assembler syntax

2.1.1  Instruction syntax

2.1.1.1  Data access

    Moving data to or from a register involves two simple rules;
'mov eax,myvar' will place the offset (address) of 'myvar' in the eax
register, while 'mov eax,[myvar]' will place the 32-bit value of the
variable 'myvar' in eax.  Note that fasm will exit with an error if 'myvar'
has not been defined as a 32-bit value. When 'myvar' has not been defined
as 32-bit value, but you need to assemble instruction 'mov eax,[myvar]',
use size override: 'mov eax,dword [myvar]', or (short form):
'mov eax,d[myvar]'. This is dangerous if 'myvar' has been defined as an
8-bit or a 16-bit variable; eax will contain whatever is in the four bytes
beginning at the address of 'myvar'!

2.1.1.2  Jumps and calls

    Unconditional:

	jmp  alfa		 ; simple jump
	jmp  near byte beta	 ; short jump
	jmp  near dword beta	 ; force dword size
	jmp  10h:50h		 ; far jump
	call far pword [1000h]	 ; 32-bit far call
	call far dword [delta]	 ; 16-bit far call
	call near dword [delta]  ; 32-bit near call

    Conditional:

	je   alfa		 ; will be optimized
	jge  byte alfa		 ; force byte (error if out of range)
	jb   dword alfa 	 ; force dword (no optimization)

2.1.1.3  Labels and constants

    Examples of defining labels:

	alfa:			      ; simple label
	     label     beta	      ; as above
	     label     gamma byte     ; low byte of delta dword
	delta	       dd 0	      ; data label
	epsilon = alfa + 1	      ; constant definition

    Local labels:

	sigma:
	.alfa:			      ; local label (1)
	     jmp  .alfa 	      ; jump to (1)
	omega:
	.alfa:			      ; local label (2)
	     jmp  .alfa 	      ; jump to (2)
	     jmp  sigma.alfa	      ; jump to (1)

2.1.1.4  Addresses

    Defining size of address value is allowed; '[word 4]' and '[dword 4]'
will generate different output code: [0000] and [00000000], '[word bx]'
will be [bx+0000], '[byte bx]' will be [bx+00], '[dword ebx+1]' will
be [ebx+00000001], etc.

2.1.1.5  Special cases

    'xlat' instruction accepts no arguments, or one argument:
'[bx]'/'byte [bx]' to create 16-bit version, or '[ebx]'/'byte [ebx]'
to create 32-bit version of opcode; in the similar way advanced settings
of string instructions can be done, like 'movs byte [es:edi],[fs:esi]',
to adjust address registers size and segment override ('movs' needs two
arguments). 'xlatb', 'movsb', etc. accept no arguments.

2.1.2  Number syntax

    Decimal numbers: 15, 15d
    Binary: 1011b
    Hexadecimal: ABh, 0xAB (case sensitive)
    Operators: +,-,*,/,mod,not,and,or,xor,shl,shr

2.1.3  Logical expressions syntax

    See 'macros' examples in Section 2.2.1 for usage examples.
The logical operators are: ~ (not), | (or), & (and); when you want
to use 'true' and 'false' values in logical expressions, define
them using 'equ': 'true equ 0=0', 'false equ ~true'.

2.1.4  Defining constants

    As opposed to 'equ', '=' works with values only, and they are
calculated at define time; for example 'xyz = $' defines xyz symbol
as an address of point where it was defined, 'xyz equ $' will just
define equivalent to '$', which will be always address of point
where it's used.

2.1.5  Defining data

    Data can be defined in two ways; if the data is to be initialised
to a specific value, the forms are:

	gdtr	  db	16,0,0,0,0,0,0	      ; sequence of bytes
	attrib	  db	0x1E		      ; single byte (hexadecimal)
	col	  db	0		      ; single byte
	command:  times 127 db 0	      ; byte string
	str001	  db	'test.bin',0	      ; character string
	argv:	  times 10 dd 0 	      ; ten 32-bit double words

    Other forms available are:

	dw   ; 16-bit word
	dp   ; 48-bit pointer
	dq   ; 64-bit quad word

    If it is only desired to reserve space for data, the forms are:

	_proname  rd   1
	_inch	  rb   1
	newstack  rd   255
	stacktop  rd   1
	freemem   rd   1

    Other forms available are:

	rw   ; 16-bit word
	rp   ; 48-bit pointer
	rq   ; 64-bit quad word

    Note that if the pre-defined 'times' macro is to be used to define
multiple data items, any label used must end with a colon.

    There's no struc directive in fasm, but when you really need, in most
cases you can do the same thing easily using macros:

	macro pixel name,x,y,color
	 {
	  name:
	  .x dw x
	  .y dw y
	  .color db color
	 }

	virtual at 0
	 pixel pixel,?,?,?
	end virtual

	; so we have pixel.x, pixel.y and pixel.color offsets defined

	pixel mypix,10,10,4

	; and now also mypix.x, mypix.y, mypix.color variables

    To handle cases, when one or more of macro params are empty (for
example just: 'pixel mypix'), you can write something like '.x dw x+0',
or use 'if <x> equ <>'.

2.2  Directives

2.2.1  Preprocessor directives

include - includes source file in source code before assembly

macro - defines macro instructions, arguments are macro name and names
	of macro arguments separated with commas, then '{' (start of macro
	character, macro instructions, and '}' (end of macro) character.
	Macroinstructions may have empty arguments; to check if argument
	is empty use something like 'if <argument> equ <>'.
	If a macro is defined that uses an instruction with the same name
	inside the macro definition, the previous meaning of this name is
	used; useful redefinition of macros can be done in that way, for
	example:

	macro mov arg1,arg2
	 {
	  if (arg1 equ ds | arg1 equ es) & (arg2 equ ds | arg2 equ es)
	     push  arg2
	     pop   arg1
	  else
	     mov   arg1,arg2  ; here original mov instruction will be used
	  end if
	 }
	macro mov arg1,arg2,arg3
	 {
	  if <arg3> equ <>
	     mov   arg1,arg2  ; here previous macro will be used
	  else
	     mov   arg1,arg2
	     mov   arg2,arg3
	  end if
	 }
	mov   ax,bx	   ; just 'mov ax,bx'
	mov   ds,es	   ; 'push es' and 'pop ds'
	mov   es,ds,dx	   ; 'push ds', 'pop es' and 'mov ds,dx'

	But note that using these macros in big programs will dramatically
	slow down assembly (up to 4 times!) and increase memory requirements.

local - used inside macro definitions, defines local symbols, which
	will have unique names in every macro call; arguments are local
	symbol names, separated with commas.

purge - argument is one or more macro names, separated with commas; this
	directive will remove last definition of specified macro; for example
	when you've redefined some macro, you can get previous definition
	back using purge (it's different than TASM in this respect; there
	purge eliminates all macros of that name). If the macro has not been
	defined, you won't get any error (exactly like in TASM).
	When you need do totally undefine some non-preprocessor symbol
	(defined with equ, or labels), use this clever macro:

	macro undefine symbol
	 {
	  local undefined
	  symbol equ undefined
	 }

	For example after 'undefine add', you can't use 'add' instruction,
	but definition and usage of 'add' label is possible. Also, if you
	use '_add equ add', and then 'undefine add', you can define 'add'
	label and have access to 'add' instruction using '_add' symbol.

equ - defines symbolic constant.

2.2.2  Code settings

use16 or use32 - set code type to 16-bit or 32-bit (use16 is default).

org - argument must be an address value; set from what address this
      code will start in memory.

format - set output file format, can be set binary or MZ; binary
	 is the default format, MZ is an EXE file format.

label - define label, needed argument is a name of label, optional
	arguments are size of label and 'at <address>' phrase.

segment - define segment at current position (only in MZ format),
	  code will be aligned to paragraph.  In segment definition, after
	  segment name, 'use16' or 'use32' is allowed.

entry - define program entry point (only in MZ format), argument must
	be a segment:offset address (like in far jump).

stack - define program stack size (only in MZ format), when no stack
	is defined, default size of 2000h bytes is used.  Or, the stack
	location can be defined in segment:offset form.

heap - define 'heap' size in paragraphs (only in MZ format) - argument
       is a 16-bit value, defining maximum size of additional heap in
       paragraphs (note that this is heap in addition to stack and undefined
       data; use 'heap 0' to always allocate only memory program really
       needs); default value of 'heap' is FFFFh.

2.2.3  Other directives

times - repeat instruction n times; arguments are number of repeats and
	instruction to repeat (optionally character ':' can be used to
	separate number and instructions), also % variable (current repeat
	number) can be used in instruction, so 'times 5 db %' will create
	01,02,03,04,05 bytes; recurrency is also allowed, so
	'times 3 times % db %' will create 01,01,02,01,02,03 bytes.

repeat - larger version of times directive, repeat has one argument -
	 number of repeats, instructions to repeat are expected in next
	 lines, ended with 'end repeat' directive.

virtual - creates virtual code or data at specified address; this data
	  won't be included in output file, but labels defined there can
	  be useful in other parts of program; argument to virtual is
	  'at <address>' phrase, virtual instructions are expected in
	  next lines, ended with 'end virtual' directive.

if - used to assemble some part of codes, when specified conditions are
     met; argument is a logical expression, in next lines instructions to
     assemble when this expression value is true, then 'end if' directive,
     or 'else', or 'else if' and next logical expression.

end - used to end structures defined with some other directives,
      correct forms are 'end repeat', 'end virtual' and 'end if'.
